I’m a Software Engineering Undergraduate at the University of Colombo (BIT-External).
I’m mainly focusing on PHP, Java, Java Script, HTML and CSS. I like to learn new technologies and adepts to them in a short period of time.
I love to work as a team and try my best to fulfill the responsibilities given to me.
